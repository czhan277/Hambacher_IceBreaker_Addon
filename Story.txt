There once was a man owned his own baeckerei and made exceptional brot. He believed his good-luck Lederhose was responsible for his wettbewerbsfaehig Apfelkuchen.  He was particularly proud of the medal he won for his gebaeck in the previous competition held at Eltz. The man had no klimaanlage in his baeckerei, and the weather was very hot in the summer so he spent much of it sitting idly in the local biergarten with his sleepy hund. The the nearby flughafen kept his hund awake much of the time, but the hund was given treats of brot, which helped make up for the trouble. On the weekends, the man and his hund would take joy rides to Berlin in their Porche 911.
